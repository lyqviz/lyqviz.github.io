    <p>This is a design project from the Information Design Studio class in my first semester at Noreastern University. Professor Douglass Scott gave everyone in class a different country and asked us to create information graphics for it, with a specific set of attributes of general importance. I was assigned Pakistan as my country. I worked on my design for the next month and a half.</p>
