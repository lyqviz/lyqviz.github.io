  <h2>Project Background</h2>

  <div class="story">
    <p>This is a design project from the Information Design Studio class in my first semester at Northeastern University. Professor Douglass Scott gave everyone in class a different country and asked us to create information graphics for it, with a specific set of attributes of general importance. I was assigned Pakistan as my country. I worked on this project for the next month and a half, the final poster print size is 17in x 42in.</p>

    <p>To begin with, we were given a list of 30 pieces of information (image below, sorry for the mess of notes!) we were asked to illustrate as part of the final deliverable. It did look overwhelming at first. The moment I saw all required information we need to present in the final poster, my automatic thought was how to organize all of these disjointed pieces of information into a coherent infographics.</p>

    <p>Before I started my ideas, I had taken a decision on two things that would guide my deliverable. First, I decided the size of the poster. I wanted to make it in the form of a large vertical poster so that it would work well in both print and digital media and, one could see the information all at once or by scrolling (if digital) in only one direction. Second, I wanted to incorporate Pakistan’s national color or similar one in the poster. In the end, I found grey always seems to work like magic for me. It made the design much more subtle and allowed me to highlight the important areas. </p>

    <p>Usually, the design process starts from sketches, from rough draft to refined version, then full-size prototype. I created sketches to see how various data points could be visualized on the poster. I experimented with different types of charts and often questioned, which one would be apt for a given data set. I also grouped the information into meaningful categories such as land, people, economy, infrastructure and Trade etc. This project opened the floodgates of knowledge about a country I knew very little about, although it's my home country's neighbor. During the process, I start to love sketching. I mention this specifically because I have experienced ‘drawing-shaming’ in the past. Stepping out of this comfort zone is something I enjoy as a designer.</p>

    <p>I experimented many ways to organize contents through hierarchy and spatial organization of grid structures. The final design took the shape I was satisfied with after several iterations. Design requires a right balance of patience and time-management. This project was a primer to that experience. Striking the right equilibrium of communication, aesthetics, and structure is a never ending challenge, and assignments like these help me get hands dirty on such multi-dimensional challenges early on.</p>
