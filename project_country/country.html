  <h2>Project Background</h2>

  <div class="story">
    <p>This is a design project from the Information Design Studio class in my first semester at Northeastern University. Professor Douglass Scott gave everyone in class a different country and asked us to create information graphics for it, with a specific set of attributes of general importance. I was assigned Pakistan as my country. I worked on this project for the next month and a half, the final poster print size is 17in x 42in.</p>

    <p>To begin with, we were given a list of 30 data points or variables (image below, sorry for the mess of notes!) we were asked to illustrate as part of the final deliverable. It did look overwhelming at first.</p>

    <p>The moment I saw all required information we need to present in a poster in the end, my automatic thought was how to organize all of these disjointed pieces of information into a coherent infographics. Like what kinds of graphics like chart or mapthe space each piece of information will use? and also I need to decide what kinds of graphics, chart or map, I will use or the space each part will use.   “Oh, I can turn this information in into bar charts, and this will look good in a pie chart .. and then I can turn this into maps. But wait, how will I organize all of these disjoint pieces of information?? What should I worry about first – the charts or the overall organization??” And, this has been a never-ending process for me. What comes first in a graphic design challenge with a lot of information to display? Is it the building blocks in the form of the information/charts design or the organizing principles themselves that provide the structure to the final design?</p>

    <p>Let me break the suspense by showing you what I finally created before I take you through the long journey of how this came about.</p>

    <p>During this project, I start to love sketching ideas. I mention this specifically because I have experienced ‘drawing-shaming’ in the past - I think I'm bad at drawing. In the field of design it is best not to get insecure about how good your sketch looks because there is always someone better than you. The only way for one to keep going is by working on the skills you want to improve.</p>




    <p>The design class is quite open, it’s an iterative process, everyone brings new version of individual project in a way showing progress every week, and get feedback from professor and classmates every week, keep refining the work.</p>
