  <h2>Project Background</h2>

  <div class="story">
    <p>This is a design project from the Information Design Studio class in my first semester at Northeastern University. Professor Douglass Scott gave everyone in class a different country and asked us to create information graphics for it, with a specific set of attributes of general importance. I was assigned Pakistan as my country. I worked on this project for the next month and a half, the final poster print size is 17in x 42in.</p>

    <p>To begin with, we were given a list of 30 pieces of information. we were asked to illustrate as part of the final deliverable. It did look overwhelming at first. The moment I saw all required information we need to present in the final poster, my automatic thought was how to organize all of these disjointed pieces of information into a coherent infographics.</p>

  <h2>Design Process</h2>

  <div class="story">

    <p>Usually, the design process starts from sketches, from rough draft to refined version, then full-size prototype. I created sketches to see how various data points could be visualized on the poster. I experimented with different types of charts and often questioned, which one would be apt for a given data set. I also grouped the information into meaningful categories such as land, people, economy, infrastructure and trade etc. for the color palette, I incorporated Pakistanâ€™s national color or similar one in the poster. I experimented many ways to organize contents through hierarchy and spatial organization of grid structures. The final design took the shape I was satisfied with after several iterations.</p>
