  <h2>Project Background</h2>

  <div class="story">
    <p>This is a design project from the Information Design Studio class in my first semester at Northeastern University. Professor Douglass Scott gave everyone in class a different country and asked us to create information graphics for it, with a specific set of attributes of general importance. I was assigned Pakistan as my country. I worked on this project for the next month and a half, the final poster print size is 17in x 42in.</p>

    <p>To begin with, we were given a list of 30 data points or variables (image below, sorry for the mess of notes!) we were asked to illustrate as part of the final deliverable. It did look overwhelming at first. The moment I saw all required information we need to present in the final poster, my automatic thought was how to organize all of these disjointed pieces of information into a coherent infographics.</p>

    <p>Even before I started my ideas, I had taken a decision on two things that would guide my deliverable. First, I decided the size of the deliverable. I wanted to make it in the form of a large vertical poster so that it would work well in both print and digital media and, one could see the information all at once or by scrolling (if digital) in only one direction. Second, I wanted to incorporate Pakistan’s national color or similar one in the poster.</p>

    <p>I created quick sketches to see how various data points could be visualized on the poster. I experimented with different types of charts and often questioned, which one would be apt for a given data set. At this stage, I also grouped the data points into meaningful categories such as land, people, economy, infrastructure and, communication.</p>

    <p>This project opened the floodgates of knowledge about a country I knew very little about. During the process, I also start to love sketching ideas. I mention this specifically because I have experienced ‘drawing-shaming’ in the past - I think I'm bad at drawing. In the field of design it is best not to get insecure about how good your sketch looks because there is always someone better than you. The only way for one to keep going is by working on the skills you want to improve. Stepping out of this comfort zone is something I enjoy as a designer.</p>

    <p>The design process is quite open. It’s iterative, everyone brings new version of individual project in a way showing progress, and get feedback from professor and classmates every week, keep refining the work. it's a never-ending process for me</p>
