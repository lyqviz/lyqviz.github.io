  <h2>Project Background</h2>

  <div class="story">
    <p>This is a design project from the Information Design Studio class in my first semester at Northeastern University. Professor Douglass Scott gave everyone in class a different country and asked us to create information graphics for it, with a specific set of attributes of general importance. I was assigned Pakistan as my country. I worked on this project for the next month and a half.</p>

    <p>To begin with, we were given a list of 30 data points or variables (image below, sorry for the mess of notes!) we were asked to illustrate as part of the final deliverable. It did look overwhelming at first.</p>

    <p>The moment I saw the problem statement, my mind started churning - “Oh, I can turn this information in into bar charts, and this will look good in a pie chart .. and then I can turn this into maps. But wait, how will I organize all of these disjoint pieces of information?? What should I worry about first – the charts or the overall organization??” And, this has been a never-ending process for me. What comes first in a graphic design challenge with a lot of information to display? Is it the building blocks in the form of the information/charts design or the organizing principles themselves that provide the structure to the final design?</p>

    <p>Let me break the suspense by showing you what I finally created before I take you through the long journey of how this came about.</p>
