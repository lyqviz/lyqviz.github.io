  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <div class="story">
    <p>This is a spatial analysis project from the GIS class I took at Columbia. When I pitched a story about the extent of air pollution in China which is not a new topic in a long time, I noticed China has been under the increasing pressure to deal with bad air quality which damages to peopleâ€™s health and released lots of regulation policies to fix this. Especially, Haze gets worse during the winter when millions of people in the north of the country fire coal for heat.</p>

    <p>The Ministry of Environmental Protection regulated 28 cities to replace coal with gas from the beginning 2017. A set of hourly monitoring data from 152 sampling stations across these 28 cities was released, covering four months from December 2016 to March 2017. This spatial analysis investigates the extent of PM2.5 pollution in this area during the winter.

  <h2>Documendation</h2>
    <div class="story">

    <p>From the four months average PM2.5 data, after interpolation, the prediction concentration map indicates cities in the west from the map stay unhealthy even very unhealthy status which means PM2.5 is over 300ug/m3. Cities like Shijiazhuang, Yangquan and Taiyuan are exposure to the heaviest extent. Cities like Tianjin, Binzhou and Cangzhou in the northeast from the map are under the good level which means PM2.5 is less than 50ug/m3. Most cities are moderate status (less than 100ug/m3).</p>

    <p>After calculating the extent of population exposure to PM2.5, the map shows cities in the west part like Yangquan, Taiyuan and Xingtai where are less or moderate populated are exposure to the PM2.5 heavily. The most populated 3 cities Beijing, Tianjin and Zhengzhou, especially Tianjin, are exposure to the PM2.5 in a moderate extent. The table shows the extent number of exposure for each city. The prediction standard error map quantifies the uncertainty for each cities. Locations near stations generally have lower error.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="story">

    <p>The spatial analysis of air quality data shows that cities like Taiyuan, Yangquan and Shijiazhuang had severer PM2.5 concentration extent than other cities. People in less populated areas such as Yangquan, Xingtai get more exposure, people in higher populated cities like Beijing, Tianjin get less exposure to the PM2.5 in the winter. The reason for this situation, it is possible that more coal production factories are located in less populated cities like Taiyuan, Yangquan where are in the primary coal production province Shanxi.</p>
