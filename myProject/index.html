						From 1990 to 2015, the world under five mortality rate <strong>decreased</strong> from 72.54% to 31.84%, which is a great success for every human being. However, the number of under five death is still relatively <strong>high</strong>. Especially in <strong>Sub-Saharan Africa area</strong>, it has continuely been one of the most severe killers of new borns.
            </br>The World has conducted a high amount of effort in order to improve the situation, from which, the <strong>education of women</strong> has become a vital subject to most scholars.

            Half the reduction in child mortality over the past 40 years can be attributed to the <strong>better education of women</strong>, according to the analysis published in the journal Lancet (<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61257-3/abstract">Click for article</a>). For every <strong>one-year</strong> increase in the average education of reproductive-age women, a country experienced a <strong>9.5 percent</strong> decrease in the child deaths.
            </br>A mother's education affects her children's health in myriad ways.
            </br>Better-educated women are more likely to understand disease-prevention measures such as vaccines and mosquito nets, and to use them. They are more likely to take a sick child to a clinic early and to follow treatment instructions. They are more likely to understand germ theory and set clean water and sanitation as household priorities.
            </br>
            </br>In the past ten years, many global organizations have made tons of efforts to increase the female education rate in those developing countries. While their results are clear and cheerful, we shall not ignore other possible factors that may also affect both female education and the child mortality. For instance, the community circumstance that the mother and the child lived in can be a significant variable that we need to take into account.
